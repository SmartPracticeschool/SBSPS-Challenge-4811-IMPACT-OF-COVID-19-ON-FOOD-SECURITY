PROBLEM:

Impact Of COVID 19 worldwide has seen a drastic effect on mankind especially if it is related to the living.
Under complete lockdown, factories and other production units which are responsible for producing Retail and supply products are all paused for a moment.
The agricultural farm is affected due to lack of manpower hence less effectiveness, causing a hike in an increase of demand but a decrease in the supply chain.

SOLUTION:

It is important to keep in mind all the factors related to food security and think of the future to cope up with demands, for this reason visualizing the 
production and utilization is important. We have created a Machine Learning model to predict the food price index for a certain period and understand the change in supply demand gap.
